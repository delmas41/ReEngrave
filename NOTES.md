# ReEngrave — backlog / research notes

Forward-looking ideas. Not yet scoped, not yet scheduled. Surface these to Sean at the start of a ReEngrave session.

## YOLO training via symphony MusicXML × multiple IMSLP editions (2026-05-23)

**Idea**: avoid hand-labeling ~500 cells for measure-line detection by using existing symphony MusicXML as ground truth, then pulling every available PDF edition of those same symphonies from IMSLP and training YOLO to detect structural elements (measure lines, stems, rhythms) by comparing detections against the XML.

**Why it works for structural elements**:
- MusicXML *is* authoritative for measure boundaries, stem direction, rhythm.
- Sean already has the MusicXML for the symphonies in question — no labeling cost.
- IMSLP has multiple engraved editions of the canonical symphonies (Beethoven, Brahms, etc.) — instant data multiplier per work.

**Limits to remember**:
- MusicXML will likely be missing dynamics, expression marks, articulations, technique markings, and other notation the original score has. This pipeline is **only** useful for the structural classes the XML can verify. Dynamics / expression / technique training still needs another approach.

**Publisher/era as a transfer-learning axis**:
- Track edition, publisher, and publication date metadata per training PDF.
- Hypothesis: a model trained on, e.g., all Beethoven symphonies engraved by Breitkopf & Härtel in 1862–1890 will generalize to *other* composers' symphonies engraved by the same publisher in the same window — engraving conventions track the publisher/era, not the composer.
- This implies the training pipeline should be sliceable by publisher × era, not just by composer.

**Action item (research, no code yet)**:
- Investigate the major score publishers across symphonic repertoire and their active windows. Goal is a categorization scheme: publisher → era → engraving style. Likely candidates to map: Breitkopf & Härtel, Peters, Schirmer, Eulenburg, Universal Edition, Bärenreiter, Henle. For each: when active, what they engraved, distinguishing visual conventions.

**Status**: parked. No action this session — Sean wants this brought up next time he's actively working on ReEngrave.
