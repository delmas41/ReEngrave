# 2.260 / 2.260a — The page is the ledger (STAGED; Sean 2026-11-03)

Plan: `docs/plan-2026-11-03-page-ledger.md` (finishes 2.240 steps 4-5). Filed by the manager from the
lane reports (a hook refuses report files from subagents).

## 2.260 step 1 — audit (no code)
- **No stage after GATHER reads pixels** (adjudicate/, evaluate, infer, export import no cv2/numpy except
  `consequences.py:1054`). GATHER files cell-framed records (detector boxes, Q.STROKE,
  Q.BEAM_STROKE_INK, Q.GLYPH_BOX) and later stages re-judge cut pieces ("is this stroke thin?",
  "are 2 heads under this box?").
- **Why page-wide readers did not take over:** the cell readers came first (pad 05-14, beam ink tests
  10-09, arc trace 10-17; claims 10-22..10-29); claims were added BESIDE old rules (deletion deferred to
  2.194 step 10, never done); a stroke carried no "cut by the cell edge" fact; the 10-29 "stays per cell"
  list held beams, stems and ledgers -- the marks a 4-6 sp pad cannot hold.
- Staff-barline ink split across two cells on ~80% of barlines (78% Litolff, 83% Brahms).

## 2.260 step 2 — design (see the plan)
**Process lesson:** a design step with no symptom of its own (the page stroke map) queued behind the
lanes that carry its symptoms (2.204 barline abstentions, 2.259 clipped beams, 2.258 arc pieces), which
kept paying for it one reader at a time.

## 2.260a M0-M2 (lane-2.260a-page-strokes cfcfc01cc; landed main a481c03e7)
- **M0 `OMR_STROKE_CUT_FACT` -- LANDED ON.** Cause: the cell crop cut tall beams and later readers judged
  the sliver as the mark. GATHER files a `cut` fact (cell-crop edges a stroke touches, page border
  ignored) on Q.STROKE / Q.BEAM_STROKE_INK; a beam cut at top/bottom is no longer refused `too_thin`;
  the stroke map's missing level says cannot-tell (`cut_abstains`), counted `beam_cut_kept`.
  Litolff p6+p16: notes +3, beams +4, accidental +1, value ~1, pitch ~1, red bars 0 -> 0, notes not
  written 774 -> 771; Brahms p5+p8 unchanged; judged right->wrong 0 (165 tiles), unwritten->wrong 0.
  The parked 2.259 patch gave notes +4, beams +4.
  Sean's tiles (answers-m0.json): "Tile 1 is a half note, tile 2 is an eighth note, tile 3 is an eighth
  note, tile 4 is a quarter note, tile 5 is an eighth note, tile 6 is an eighth note, tile 7th is an
  eighth note." -- 7/7 right (controls 1, 2, 4; tile 3 quarter -> eighth; 5-7 gained eighths).
  Gate: fast tier 9880 passed, 0 failed; real 2-page gather finished.
- **M1 `OMR_BARLINE_COLUMN_FACT` -- merged OFF.** Tilted column (slope + intercept) refit in
  `staged/barline_columns.py` with the extractor's own Theil-Sen (measure_extractor.py untouched), filed
  `Q.BARLINE_COLUMN_FIT`. Lesson: `Q.BARLINE_COLUMN` already existed and the first version silently
  redefined it. Litolff p6: 28 columns, 14 tilted >= 0.45 sp, one drifts 24.7 px over a system; Brahms
  p5: 20, none. Export byte-identical.
- **M2 `OMR_PAGE_STROKES` -- merged OFF, read by nothing.** `staged/page_strokes.py`: one raster from
  each staff's own erased band + page.binary outside the bands, M1 column carved first, the cell map's
  finders run once on the page; `Q.PAGE_STROKE`. Controls: same-frame parity Litolff p6 99.7% vs 19%
  with bands shifted 6 px; Brahms p5 84% vs 27% (noise floor 80.5%); rule-like barline strokes 0/308 L,
  1/280 B vs 85%/92% on the cell map; export byte-identical. Cost 4.0 s/page vs 6.8 s for the cell
  maps (Brahms 6.6 vs 9.9); canvas 11 MB (46 MB Brahms); record +6% L / +4% B; peak RSS unchanged.

## Not established
Brahms parity sits at its noise floor; the page map's split with real detector boxes untested; carve
widths and run lengths are untuned constants. M1/M2 matter only from M3 (claims name page strokes).

## 2.260b — M3: claims name page strokes, arcs first (absorbs 2.258; NOT landed)
Lane `lane-2.260b-m3-claims` round 2 head f95ef29ea, `OMR_PAGE_CLAIMS` OFF (turns on M1 + M2). The 2.258 lane agent was stopped mid-run (likely by a user interrupt; see DECISIONS/memory) after building `OMR_ARC_ONE_CURVE`; its code was reused here.

**Reader table (step 1)** -- Q = the one traced page curve, B = detector boxes / cell pieces:
`_page_binding` ends Q (trace cut at box + 0.5 sp: right question, short answer); `_joins_not_at_a_barline` B -- WRONG question (where boxes stand, not what the trace proved), causes the 68; `adjudicate_arc_kind` OFF path / `_flank_search` / `_two_note_reading` B; `adjudicate_tie_pair` Q when bound else B; export `_place_arcs` / `_noteheads_under` B per cell piece; `_page_bound_slur_spans`, `_anchored_slur_spans` Q; `stroke_owner._arc_claims` cell strokes `[[cell, ordinal]]`; beam discount `_not_a_decided_arc` / `_strokes_on_a_system_arc` B; `_arc_tail_refusal`, `_arc_ink_refusal` B + cell edge; `claims.heading_blocks`, `page_owner.not_ledger_maker` Q.
**Cause:** the page-wide trace is already one curve; the binder re-asked the cell boxes. **Lesson:** a later reader must ask the claimed object, not re-derive it from the pieces the claim replaced.
**Counts (Litolff p10+11):** `joined_not_at_a_barline` 33 curves (30 twin boxes of ONE stroke in one cell, 3 a barline cut; 6/6 crops clean single arcs); `end_unbound` 72 curves / 117 ends (63 no head within 3 sp, 29 head ADJUDICATE left unusable, 19 head 1.6-2.6 sp past the window, 6 > 2.5 sp off in y).

**Round 1** (flat 3 sp end extension): STOPPED -- a Brahms p0 hand-truth tie (q1099) became a slur; Brahms ties -14.
**Round 2** (guard asks the page map/trace; an unbound end extends only along its own page stroke; an end bound OFF never moves): fast tier 9887 passed; Litolff p10+11 ties +2 slurs +10, `joined_not_at_a_barline` boxes 67 -> 6, bound ties 49 -> 53, slurs 30 -> 37; Brahms p0 hand truth unchanged (ties 28, slurs 27; q1099, q1233, q953, q1071, q1405 identical to OFF); judged right->wrong 0. Brahms "slurs -16": by exact span 8 instances, none a real loss (6 OFF duplicates, 1 OFF non-arc on staff lines, 1 re-bound to the long slur the print shows); 16 vs 8 not reconciled.
**Sean's tiles (answers-2.260b-r2.json): 9/12.** Tiles 2, 3, 9 are same-note ties written as SLURS. Tile 2 was a tie OFF -> RIGHT->WRONG (the judged scorer missed it: not a judged place). Cause for 2 and 9: the arc ties the UPPER head of a ledger dyad, which is never a usable bound head (`far_head_ledger_unread`); the binder binds neighbours, one end via a stem tip with an unread step, and `page_binding_different_pitch` reads unread-vs-read as "different". Tile 3 (Brahms p0): the slur does not come from the binder; untraced.
**Sean's ruling:** a tie is read from POSITION, not pitch (page-facts §1, DECISIONS 2026-11-03).
**Round 3 (next):** (1) the tie test compares the two end heads' staff POSITIONS measured locally (page map), never waits on a ledger count; unread pitch is doubt only where positions differ; (2) bind the dyad's upper head as the arc end; (3) trace tile 3's slur source; re-measure Litolff p10+11, Brahms p0+p5 (Brahms p0 hand truth unchanged, judged 0, and Sean's r2 tiles 2/3/9 re-read as ties); hairpin/barline/word claims stay on the next list.
